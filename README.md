# Wiley-Edge-projects
The one's that do not have my name I had contributed in some way to the project.
That info is listed in a seperate read me. All of these projects utilize the MVC project
structure with the Vending Machine project and the Superhero sightings group project all 
using Spring MVC and SpringBoot in some form, as shown in the respective XML files.
